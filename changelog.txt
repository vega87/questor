      then where required by the settings xml

    - If you are in a Capsule, Questor will no longer undock your ship.

      </action>

Monday, February 14, 2011:

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Fixed logging (it no longer shows type-information in certain log entries)

    - Changed the arm-mode to bring assembled ammo first. (e.g. assembled crystals)

    - Changed ammo function for energy weapons (e.g. lasers) to correctly load
      crystals with a preference for assembled crystals first.
      Note: For lasers to work, set your minimum charges to -1 ! (minus 1)

    - Fixed detection of Tracking Disruptor EW

    - Added detection of Neutralizer EW

    - Made drones assist the weapons on high value targets that are within 
      drone control range. Drones will otherwise attack the lowest value target
      until the weapon-target is within range.

    - Fixed some misc-stuff concerning lasers / crystals

    - Added Toxic Waste, (Elite) Slaves and Small Arms to the contraband list

    - If no ammo is specified in the mission xml file, Questor will now bring
      ammo based on the faction in the mission briefing.

    - No faction in the mission briefing and no custom XML now means EM-damage.

    - Missions in the blacklist now also get filtered (see previous changes)

    - Spaces infront or spaces at the end of the mission name are now removed.

    - Double spaces in the mission name are now removed.

    - Added a check to make sure the agent exists before continue'ing

    - Added a check to make sure all 4 damage types have been defined in the
      settings xml file.

    - Invalid weapon GroupId now generates an Out of Ammo warning in the combat
      module and makes Questor return to base.

    - Added live-reloading of the settings configuration file when it changes.

    - If, for some reason, you get a priority target while traveling (e.g.
      you get warp scrambled), the bot will now fire at the priority targets.

Sunday, January 30, 2011:

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Added "Ignore" action to Mission XML files, this action will allow you to 
      add and remove targets from the ignore list. Here an example:
      <action name="Ignore">
        <parameter name="Add" value="Core Flotilla Admiral" />
        <parameter name="Add" value="Core Rear Admiral" />
        <parameter name="Remove" value="Core Admiral" />
        <parameter name="Remove" value="Guardian Veteran" />
      </action>
      NOTE: The ignore list resets when Questor moves to a new pocket!

    - Added the ability to have multiple parameters with the same name for the 
      following actions: Loot [target+item parameters], Kill [target parameter]

    - Added the LootItem action, this action is the same as Loot except that it
      will only loot the specific item, regardless of the LootEverything option
      in the settings XML.

    - Questor will now activate your sensor booster and tracking computer.
      NOTE: Questor will not change scripts!

    - Questor should now move assembled drones correctly

    - Questor will now add NPCs to the priority list that perform ECM, 
      Sensor Dampening, Target Painting, Tracking Disrupting.

    - Questor should no longer return home if the cargo bay was not open when 
      in salvage mode with a message "cargo full" when it was not full.

    - Questor now recalls drones if the actions "Activate" or "Done" get 
      executed. The recall will get overriden if an NPC is warp scrambling.

    - Added the "IgnoreAttackers" parameter to the Kill action.

    - Illegal characters are filtered out of both the character name and mission
      name. The following characters are replaced with nothing:
      \/?"'*:><.,
      This means a mission with this name "Are You Receiving? (1 of 3)" will 
      look for this xml "Are You Receiving (1 of 3).xml" .

Tuesday, January 18, 2011:

  * Fixed Questor to work with the new EVE release.

Sunday, January 16, 2011:

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Made the prefix of salvage bookmarks customizable through the xml.

    - Changed the way strings are converted from EVE to C#, this should hopefully
      stop the agent crashes that some people where having.

    - Questor now properly sees that you are cloaked and no longer tries to activate
      hardeners when cloaked.

    - Added the ability to disable the 3D rendering of EVE, note this is one of the
      few options that is normally not allowed by the game! Use at your own risk!

    - Added statistics logging (charname.statistics.log), it includes mission name,
      isk gained, estimated loot value and loyalty points. Isk gained will be off 
      due delayed bounty rewards.

Tuesday, January 11, 2011:

  * Release of ValueDump (run it with "dotnet ValueDump" from InnerSpace console)

    It can be used to sell of mission loot. Note it will sell every item that is 
    not inside a secure container (like a station container) !

  * Now supports ships with a tractor beam but without a salvager.

Sunday, January 7, 2011:

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Fixed a mission agent joural issue.

    - Fixed a looting issue.

Friday, January 7, 2011:

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Completely removed the dependency on ISXEVE.

    - If your speed tanking, then your afterburner/mwd will not be turned off 
      when your still being attacked. Previously there could be a brief period
      where your afterburner/mwd would be turned off when switching targets.

Monday, January 3, 2011:

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Refactored loot code to add more logging and handle lag better.

    - Added "Mission not complete" to the list of windows to close. We know its 
      not complete, Questor will just redo the mission.

Saturday, January 1, 2011

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Auto start would toggle on/off when you had a seperate salvage ship.

    - Fixed a session is ready-check for all west-utc users.

    - Fixed an issue with Questor not correctly identifying ships in the ship hangar.

Wednesday, December 29, 2010

  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:

    - Questor will now spread salvagers over several wrecks, if there is more 
      then one wreck in salvage range.

    - Questor will now stack the cargo of the ship every few minutes.

    - Questor will now wait until ISXEVE is fully loaded and will even load
      ISXEVE, if it has not been loaded yet

    - Revamped the user interface

    - Starting Questor mid-space will make the bot return to its homebase
      after a 15 second delay.

    - Salvager, Tractor beam and Stasis Web now get their optimal range from
      the game itself and are no longer xml settings. (Noctis fix)

    - Now automatically closes none-vital windows

    - No longer crashes eve when you have more then 400+ items in your hangar

    - Added a capacitor fail-safe, if your not being targeted and your capacitor
      is below 10%, questor will not try to activate your hardeners and/or 
      shield booster.

    - Arm-state will now correctly tell you what you are missing.

    - Arm-state will no longer stack items (UnloadLoot already does this)

    - Added drone reloading (see settings xml), only one drone type supported, regardless
      of mission damage type.

    - Added automatic login by starting Questor using the following InnerSpace command:
      dotnet Questor Questor username password charactername
      If your character has spaces in it, you can use "s, e.g.:
      dotnet Questor Questor username password "character name"
      Note: Automatic login is halted if an unexpected window is found.

  * Changes to the settings XML:

    *** IMPORTANT CHANGE ***
    - Changed: <activateShieldBooster></activateShieldBooster>
      Into: <activateRepairModules></activateRepairModules>
      If your ship is fitted with an armor rep, this value is used to
      activate the armor rep, if your ship is fitted shield booster then
      this value is used to activate your shield booster

    *** IMPORTANT CHANGE ***
    - Changed: <deactivateShieldBooster></deactivateShieldBooster>
      Into: <deactivateRepairModules></deactivateRepairModules>
      See activateRepairModules

    - Added: <minimumArmorPct></minimumArmorPct>
      This makes Questor panic if below this armor percentage, if your armor 
      tanking then make sure you set minimumShieldPct to 0 !

    - Added: <autoStart>true/false</autoStart> 
      This sets auto start enabled/disabled.

    - Added: <randomDelay>300</randomDelay> 
      This adds a random delay of 300 seconds between each mission.

    - Added: <lootHangar>LOOT</lootHangar>
      If filled in then that corp hangar is used to store loot. 
      If left empty, then your personal hangar is used.

    - Added: <ammoHangar>AMMO</ammoHangar> 
      See lootHangar

    - Added: <windowXPosition>50</windowXPosition> 
    - Added: <windowYPosition>60</windowYPosition>
      The Questor window gets moved to 50 x 60 
      (handy if you have multiple bots on one PC)

    - Removed: <tractorBeamRange></tractorBeamRange>
    - Removed: <salvagerRange></salvagerRange>
    - Removed: <stasisWebRange></stasisWebRange>

    - Added: <droneMinimumShieldPct></droneMinimumShieldPct>
    - Added: <droneRecallShieldPct></droneRecallShieldPct>
    - Added: <longRangeDroneRecallShieldPct></longRangeDroneRecallShieldPct>
      It happened a lot that the bot ran out of shields before it ran out of 
      capacitor, and as such would not recall its drones. Now you can set these
      values and the bot will check shield status when launching / recalling drones

    - Added: <droneMinimumArmorPct></droneMinimumArmorPct>
    - Added: <droneRecallArmorPct></droneRecallArmorPct>
    - Added: <longRangeDroneRecallArmorPct></longRangeDroneRecallArmorPct>
      See the shield versions, note if your armor tanking you have to set the shield
      elements to 0 !

    - Added: <droneTypeId></droneTypeId>
      The drone type id that will be reloaded.
